## 🚗 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **digital twin simulation, computer vision, and robotic control** can be integrated for precise motion planning and execution.  
We connected **Elephant Robotics' MyCobot Pro 600** to its **MATLAB Simscape digital twin**, solving a **4×4 maze** autonomously.

## 🧠 Key Components
- **Computer Vision (Python, OpenCV):**  
  Captures maze via AI-Kit camera → Detects walls, start & end blobs → Solves path using Dijkstra algorithm.
- **Kinematic Modeling (MATLAB):**  
  Defined the robot via `rigidBodyTree`, verified with forward kinematics, and validated with the digital twin.
- **Inverse Kinematics & Trajectory Planning:**  
  Converted pixel path → workspace waypoints → joint angles → verified trajectory.
- **Real-Time Control:**  
  Streamed joint angles to robot over TCP sockets for smooth, collision-free motion.
